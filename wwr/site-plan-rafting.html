    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site it to provide the grader with something not boring so that they have something entertaining to read. 
      Otherwise they get extra boared with their jobs. That's why the rubric says don't theme your page "My teacher made me".
      So I'm going to discuss how the assignments presuppasitions about what web pages are for is only applicable to web1. 
      Web1 was the first iterations of the web page. Since then we had the advent of web2 which was the social media movement. 
      Web3 is the distributed web. The web of self hosted social media. The web of DEXs and DAOs. The web of value trade and monitary freedom. 
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The grader obviously. I hope you don't mind me breaking the 4th wall like that :D
      Audience is people that are more forward thinking than to assume the web is "From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. 
      This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the Internet, or at least it should be. " as section 3 of the assignment states.
      This idea was the original web pages purpose but has since been and should be much more. 
      My other web page that I work on weekly has a much wider audience.
      That website is more dynamic and actually has a real world purpose. 
      You can see my real world business website here: https://akpoliticalinsiders.com/
